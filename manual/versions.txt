SplitSup Versions:

v 1.0:   August 1, 2016:  original released version

v 1.01:  November 2, 2016: Updated sequence file read to permit
alignments with gaps for the non-sliding window analyses also.
If SplitSup is run without the sliding window option (i.e. type
only `SplitSup' at the command line), then alignments with gaps
are read in and the number of gapless sites printed to the
terminal.  The timer code was modified to report hundredths
of seconds if user desires.

v 1.01:  July 19, 2017:  Update the manual with the correct
citation information.


v 1.02:  July 24, 2017:  Modified the SVD score computations as
follows:

   *  If the user requests r singular values to be computed
and fewer are returned by the SVD routine, the score is set to nan.

   *  Because of numerical error sometimes the sum of the squares
of the first r singular values is equal to the square of the 
Frobenius norm to within 10e-16.  The score is then set to zero.
See flatBinary.c for details.


v 1.02:  December 13, 2017:  Discovered that I never uploaded
the new version of flatBinary.c in July.  Now this is done.
