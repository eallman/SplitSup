SplitSup Versions:

v 1.0:   August 1, 2016:  original released version

v 1.01:  November 2, 2016: Updated sequence file read to permit
alignments with gaps for the non-sliding window analyses also.
If SplitSup is run without the sliding window option (i.e. type
only `SplitSup' at the command line), then alignments with gaps
are read in and the number of gapless sites printed to the
terminal.  The timer code was modified to report hundredths
of seconds if user desires.
