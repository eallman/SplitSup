This directory contains some files for becoming familiar with using
SplitSup.

The file "infile" is a PHYLIP-formatted DNA sequence file created by
Seq-Gen.  There are 25 taxa and the sequences are 500 bp.  The
sequences in infile were sorted so that the first sequence is t01, the
second is t02, etc.  This simply makes it easier to write down splits
of interest.

These files are sample splitsfiles: 
   all4splits_25taxa              (contains all 25 choose 4 4-splits)
   single4split_25taxa            (contains a single 4-split for a sliding window analysis)




Multiple splits:

For computing scores for all 4-splits, execute the following commands
at unix prompt:

   cp all4splits_25taxa splitsfile        (set the correct splitsfile)     
   SplitSup

The output in scoresfile is the scores for all 12,650 4-splits.  Save
the scoresfile to a new file if you do not want it to be overwritten.


Sliding Window analysis:

For a sliding window analysis, use the following commands: 

   cp single4split_25taxa splitsfile      (set the correct splitsfile)
   SplitSup -s -w100 -o25 -m50

This sets the window size to 100 bp, the slide size to 25 bp, and requires
a minimun number of 50 bp for a score to be computed.


Other ranks:

For performing an analysis with a rank r different from 4, use the
-rRANK option.  For example,

    SplitSup -r6

will compute scores for flattening matrices that are approximately
rank 6.
